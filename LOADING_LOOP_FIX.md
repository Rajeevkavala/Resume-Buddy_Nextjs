# Loading Dashboard Loop Fix

## Issue Identified
The "Loading Dashboard..." loop was caused by multiple interconnected loading state management issues:

1. **PageTransition Component**: Event listeners were not properly cleaned up, causing stuck loading states
2. **LoadingLink Component**: Route change complete events were not reliably dispatched
3. **ResumeContext**: `isDataLoaded` was being set to `false` in `resetState()`, creating an infinite loop
4. **Main Page Loading Logic**: Dependency on `isDataLoaded` without proper safety timeouts

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed PageTransition Component (`src/components/page-transition.tsx`)
- **Improved event listener management**: Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Added safety timeout**: Maximum 2-second loading time to prevent infinite loops
- **Better transition handling**: Use refs to manage timeouts properly
- **Initial load handling**: Don't show loading on first page load

### 2. Enhanced LoadingLink Component (`src/components/loading-link.tsx`)
- **Reliable completion events**: Use Promise-based navigation with requestAnimationFrame
- **Error handling**: Dispatch completion event even if navigation fails
- **Better async handling**: Ensure events are fired after actual navigation completion

### 3. Fixed ResumeContext Loading State (`src/context/resume-context.tsx`)
- **Removed problematic resetState**: Don't set `isDataLoaded` to false after initial load
- **Improved user switching**: Handle data loading properly when users change
- **Better initial state**: Set `isDataLoaded` to true for users with no data
- **Optimized dependencies**: Removed circular dependencies in useCallback

### 4. Added Safety Mechanisms to Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- **Safety timeout**: 3-second maximum loading time
- **Better condition handling**: Improved logic for when to show/hide loading
- **Console warnings**: Debug information for stuck loading states

## Key Changes Made

### PageTransition Component
```tsx
// Before: Event listeners could cause memory leaks and stuck states
// After: Proper cleanup and safety timeouts

// Added safety timeout
const safetyTimer = setTimeout(() => {
  setIsTransitioning(false);
}, 2000);

// Better cleanup
return () => {
  clearTimeout(safetyTimer);
  clearTimeout(normalTimer);
  // ... proper event listener cleanup
};
```

### ResumeContext
```tsx
// Before: resetState() set isDataLoaded to false
const resetState = () => {
  // ... clear state
  setIsDataLoaded(false); // This caused infinite loops!
};

// After: Keep isDataLoaded true after initial load attempt
const resetState = useCallback(() => {
  // ... clear state
  // Don't set isDataLoaded to false
}, []);
```

### LoadingLink
```tsx
// Before: Unreliable event dispatching
setTimeout(() => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('routeChangeComplete'));
}, 50);

// After: Promise-based with proper timing
Promise.resolve(navigationPromise).then(() => {
  requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('routeChangeComplete'));
  });
});
```

## Result
- ✅ **No more infinite loading loops**
- ✅ **Faster navigation with proper loading states**
- ✅ **Better error handling and recovery**
- ✅ **Improved memory management**
- ✅ **Safety timeouts prevent stuck states**

## Testing
The application now:
1. Shows loading states only when actually navigating
2. Automatically recovers from stuck loading states
3. Properly handles users with no data
4. Cleans up resources to prevent memory leaks
5. Provides debug information in development mode

The "Loading Dashboard..." should no longer appear indefinitely and navigation should be smooth and responsive.
